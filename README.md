## My process

It took me a couple hours, but im pretty happy with the final result. I had to search for a couple CSS properties to remember their values or how to use them, so i'm glad that i was able to reenforced the knowledgement

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to use a little bit more the developer section of the browser, it helped me a lot to understand and solve a few problems in the layout.

### Continued development

I'm actually happy with the results. But i'd like improve the code as much as possible in any way. Also, i tested the responsive, but i'm still unsure if it's completely responsive at this point.
